# Testing Spark: PySpark Experiments
This repository contains lab work where we utilized PySpark for performing various types of calculations on Swedish weather data. Additionally, it includes the implementation of some algorithms in PySpark.

**Lab-BDA1.py**: Performs calculations with PySpark RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets).
**Lab-BDA2.py**: Performs calculations with PySpark SQL.
**Lab-BDA3.py**: Utilizes PySpark RDD and MLLib (Machine Learning Library) for calculations. It includes the creation of a Gaussian kernel that predicts the temperature for a selected date. Furthermore, the results are compared with MLLib models such as decision trees and random forests.

**gradient_logistic_regression.py** : Implemented Gradient Logistic Regression in PySpark using iris data.
**logistic_regression** : Implemented Logistic Regression In PySpark using iris data.
